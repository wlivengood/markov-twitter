# Mnemonist

Mnemonist is a collection of classic data structures (think heap, trie etc.) for JavaScript.

It strives at being:

* As performant as possible for a high-level language.
* Completely modular (don't need to import the whole library just to use a simple heap).
* Simple & straightforward to use and consistent with JavaScript standard objects' API.

## Installation

```
npm install --save mnemonist
```

## Documentation

* [Heap](docs/heap.md)
* [Linked List](docs/linked-list.md)
* [Stack](docs/stack.md)
